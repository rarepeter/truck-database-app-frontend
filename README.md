# Key features
- Company database visualisation.
- Ability to change data and upload it to a database.
- Image uploading.
- Global storage implementation using **MobX**.

# How to use
- Clone the repository to your file system;
- Change the console file system directory to the git repository location;
- Run the install command:

```bash
npm install
```

- After the program has been installed, run the following command to start it:

```bash
npm start
```

The program will be running, and you can access the URL, but remember that this is only the frontend. For the program to function correctly, you will need a backend where you can make HTTP requests and it should also have the JWT token implementation.

You can write your own code for this, or use the **backend that I provide**. Please access the link to access my repo and instructions of use of the backend part of the application: https://github.com/rarepeter/truck-database-app-backend.
